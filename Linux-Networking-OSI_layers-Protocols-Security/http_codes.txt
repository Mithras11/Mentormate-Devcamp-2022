- 301 Moved Permanently
	The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently.
	The new URL is given in the response.  

- 302 Found
	This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily.
	Further changes in the URI might be made in the future. 
	Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests. 

- 404 Not Found
	The server can not find the requested resource.
	In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.
	In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.
	Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden 
	to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client.
	This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.
